                            <h2>Specially Why Yoga and Meditation for Japan?</h2>

                            <p>Yoga and meditation can easily integrate in the Japanese culture because they have
                                something in common. Japan is known to be in love with tranquility, order, harmony, and
                                nature. These qualities can easily be found in yoga and meditation. Many people in Japan
                                have lives that revolve around stress because of the long working hours, the congestion
                                of cities, and the demands of their workplace or educational institutions. Yoga relaxes
                                the body by relieving pain and increasing flexibility. In the same way, meditation
                                soothes the mind by lessening stress. Zen, mindfulness, and breathing meditation in
                                Japan are the same meditation that is practiced in doing yoga. Nature in Japan,
                                including mountains, forest, temples, and gardens, is serene. This is ideal for
                                meditation and yoga. Mental health in Japan is becoming a great issue in modern society.
                                Yoga and meditation will greatly work in the maintenance of this health.</p>

                                    Stress is common in Japan because of work pressure and social expectations. Long
                                    working hours can cause mental and physical tiredness. City life is also fast and
